- 👋 Hi, I’m @wrigleyDan
- 👀 I’m interested in everything connected to search: Solr, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Chorus, Quepid, Milvus, ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects related to search, either industry specific (eg. e-commerce search), projects that empower users to get more out of their search stack, etc.
- 📫 You can reach me either on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-wrigley-67925372/) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wrigley_dan)
